We will also be aggregating videos on the <a href=\"http:\/\/opensolacehaiti.mirocommunity.org\/\">Miro Community<\/a> Platform. We cannot guarantee the delivery of your message to Haitians, but we will do our best to deliver it as soon as it is feasible.

Of course, if you believe in this cause, we would certainly appreciate donations (of money or equipment). Since this is a pure, peer-to-peer, community driven volunteer effort, our overhead is non-existent. All donations will go toward the purchase of hardware to build out the network transporting these messages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How can I help?
