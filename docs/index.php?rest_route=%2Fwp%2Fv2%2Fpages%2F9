We also plan to get video messages out of Haiti and deliver them to the Brooklyn Haitian community. Additionally, we\u00c2\u00a0 want to encourage anyone to compose video postcards of hope to be sent to Haiti, but Haitian postcards will have first priority over others.<\/p>\n<p>We have observed that most of the communications efforts going on right now are focused on getting information about the Haitian situation into the hands of journalists, professional relief workers, and audiences. This is important, but we feel that it is also essential to create flows of information into, out of, and within Haiti &#8212; from Haitians to Haitians. Independent, locally, produced media, by and for Haitians.<\/p>\n<p>Our first priorities are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To connect with grassroots efforts on the ground to restore minimal mass media (e.g. low power FM radio, high power copy machines, blackboards, and projectors), and relief workers and journalists.<\/li>\n<li>To establish the &#8221;&#8217;Haitian Video Postcard Exchange Network&#8221;&#8217; as a mechanism for video messages to get into and out of Haiti. These 3 minute videos can be shot in Haiti using very inexpensive <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.crisiscommons.org\/wiki\/Hardware_Kit_(OpenSolaceWiki)\">hardware<\/a>, and played back using very inexpensive handheld video projectors. The data can be exchanged over the internet when services are restored, but they can also travel on foot, over a so called <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sneakernet\">sneakernet<\/a>, stored on SD memory cards or USB keychain drives.<\/li>\n<li>To establish the &#8221;&#8217;Haitian Micro Text Interchange&#8221;&#8217; where (very) short messages, or Tweets, from abroad are curated and filtered, and then selected for rebroadcast over low tech mass communications tools in Haiti. The return trip can take a similar trajectory.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>More\u00c2\u00a0 Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For more background on the analysis that led to this strategy and project, see\u00c2\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/gfem.org\/node\/749\">Humane Communications over Human Networks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For an understanding of just how essential information can be in a crisis, see The Red Cross\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ifrc.org\/publicat\/wdr2005\/\">World Disasters Report 2005<\/a>: Focus on information in disasters.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on our activities and planning, please visit the <a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.crisiscommons.org\/wiki\/Category:Open_Solace_Haiti\">Crisis Commons wiki<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Special thanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/crisiscommons.org\/\">Crisis Commons<\/a> project for hosting us, and providing us with infrastructure, physical space, and networking opportunities.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Open Solace Haiti Project aims to set up independent channels of communications between Haitians currently living in Haiti and Haitians outside of Haiti.
